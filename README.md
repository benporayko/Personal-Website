# Personal-Website
My Personal Website created using Spring Boot and React. Currently in development.

# Goals For This Project
My goal is for this project to serve as a portfolio of the programming work that I have done. The website homepage will contain links to relevant accounts (GitHub, LinkedIn) and provide an "about me" section. The website homepage will link to a portfolio page containing more details on projects that I have completed.

# Potential Additions
A potential addition to this website would be a blog on the homepage. This would feature original content pertaining to computer programming and potentially technology in general. The blog would have create, replace, update and delete functionality in order to create and manage blog posts. This would involve the creation of a database to store blog data.
